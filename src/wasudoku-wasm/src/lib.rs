/// Solve a Sudoku puzzle and return the logical steps and solution.
///
/// This function employs a hybrid strategy. It first applies logical solving
/// techniques to generate human-readable steps. If logic alone cannot solve
/// the puzzle, it falls back to a high-speed backtracking algorithm to find
/// the final solution.
///
/// ### Arguments
///
/// * `board_str` - An 81-character string representing the Sudoku board,
///   with `.` or `0` for empty cells.
///
/// ### Returns
///
/// * A `JsValue` containing the serialized `SolveResult`, which includes
///   the logical steps and an optional final solution string.
///
/// ### Errors
///
/// * A `JsValue` error if the input is invalid, the puzzle is unsolvable,
///   or a panic occurs in the underlying solver.
